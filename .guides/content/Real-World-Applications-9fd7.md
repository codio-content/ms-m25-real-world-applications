Let's look at what data can and should be used for. Below are some detailed business driven use cases:

1. **Advancing life sciences.** Computing power lets us decode entire DNA strings in minutes. In the future, it will help us better predict disease patterns and develop cures. Imagine what would happen if the data from every smart watch and wearable device could be gathered and analyzed, clinical trials of the future would not be limited to small sample sizes. Data is already being used to record and analyze the heart rhythms and breathing patterns of babies in neonatal ICUs, enabling algorithms that can predict infections 24 hours before physical symptoms appear.

2. **Automation of machines and devices.** Data manipulation helps machines and devices become smarter and more autonomous. For example, big data is behind the software used to operate Google's self-driving car. Similar data tools can be used to optimize energy grids using data from smart meters. We can even use big data tools to optimize the performance of computers and data warehouses.

3. **Creating smart cities.** Data is at the heart of the technology being used to create smart cities for example, letting municipalities optimize traffic flow based on real-time traffic information in conjunction with social media and weather data.

### Key takeaways

Data science is a catch-all term for a set of interdisciplinary techniques which put data to work to extract useful insights, predictions, or knowledge.
One of the biggest determinants of success for a data science project is choosing and defining a good problem to work on.

By simulating systems, we can explore how new or unexpected events might affect the population without actually putting any creatures in danger.  It is possible to determine the results of a food shortage or drought without subjecting anyone to hunger or pain.
